  abstract = {Learn and implement the latest Arm Cortex-M microcontroller development concepts such as performance optimization, security, software reuse, machine learning, continuous integration, and cloud-based development from industry expertsKey FeaturesLearn how to select the best Cortex-M hardware, software, and tools for your projectUnderstand the use of key software components and how to optimize and develop modern applicationsGet hands-on experience implementing quality software using example code provided in the bookPurchase of the print or Kindle book includes a free eBook in the PDF formatBook DescriptionCortex-M has been around since 2004, so why a new book now? With new microcontrollers based on the Cortex-M55 and Cortex-M85 being introduced this year, Cortex-M continues to expand. New software concepts, such as standardized software reuse, have emerged alongside new topics including security and machine learning. Development methodologies have also significantly advanced, with more embedded development taking place in the cloud and increased levels of automation. Due to these advances, a single engineer can no longer understand an entire project and requires new skills to be successful.This book provides a unique view of how to navigate and apply the latest concepts in microcontroller development. The book is split into two parts. First, you'll be guided through how to select the ideal set of hardware, software, and tools for your specific project. Next, you'll explore how to implement essential topics for modern embedded developers. Throughout the book, there are examples for you to learn by working with real Cortex-M devices with all software available on GitHub. You will gain experience with the small Cortex-M0+, the powerful Cortex-M55, and more Cortex-M processors.By the end of this book, you'll be able to practically apply modern Cortex-M software development concepts.What you will learnFamiliarize yourself with heuristics to identify the right components for your Cortex-M projectBoot code to efficiently start up a Cortex-M deviceOptimize algorithms with compilers, middleware, and other meansGet to grips with machine learning frameworks and implementation techniquesUnderstand security in the embedded space with solutions like TrustZone and TF-MExplore cloud-based development methodologies to increase efficiencyDive into continuous integration frameworks and best practicesIdentify future trends that could impact Cortex-M software developmentWho this book is forThis book is for practicing engineers and students working with embedded and IoT systems who want to quickly learn how to develop quality software for Arm Cortex-M processors without reading long technical manuals. If you're looking for a book that explains C or assembly language programming for the purpose of creating a single application or mastering a type of programming such as digital signal processing algorithms, then this book is NOT for you. A basic understanding of embedded hardware and software, along with general C programming skills will assist with understanding the concepts covered in this book.Table of ContentsSelecting the Right HardwareSelecting the Right SoftwareSelecting the Right ToolsBooting to MainOptimizing PerformanceLeveraging Machine LearningEnforcing SecurityStreamlining with the CloudImplementing Continuous IntegraionLooking Ahead},
